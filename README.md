# Random Number Guessing Game 🎲

A fun and interactive game where players guess a random number between 1 and 10. This is my first web development project, designed to explore the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🛠️ Features  

- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number each time the page loads.  
- **Input Validation**: Ensures users enter a valid number between 1 and 10.  
- **Score System**: Decreases the score with each incorrect guess.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
